Introduction
The Stock Predictor is an open-source tool designed to forecast stock prices using historical data. By employing machine learning models, it analyzes past price movements to predict future trends. Whether you're a trader looking for insights or a developer interested in financial modeling, this project offers a flexible and extensible platform for stock price prediction.
Why Use Stock Predictor?

Accurate predictions powered by LSTM and Linear Regression models.
Interactive command-line interface for ease of use.
Visualizations to understand historical trends and forecasts.
Open-source and customizable for advanced users.

Features

Stock Price Prediction: Forecast future prices for any stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).
Data Visualization: Generate plots of historical prices and predicted trends.
Multiple Models: Choose between LSTM (deep learning) and Linear Regression (traditional ML).
Customizable Parameters: Adjust model hyperparameters (e.g., look-back period, training epochs).
Extensible Data Sources: Integrate additional APIs beyond Yahoo Finance.
Command-Line Interface: User-friendly prompts for non-technical users.

Installation
To set up the Stock Predictor locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/alphah-dev/stock_predictor.git


Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd stock_predictor


Create a Virtual Environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Verify Python Version:Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed:
python --version



Example requirements.txt (inferred):
yfinance>=0.2.4
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.23.0
scikit-learn>=1.2.0
tensorflow>=2.10.0
matplotlib>=3.6.0

Note: If you encounter dependency issues, ensure your pip is up-to-date (pip install --upgrade pip).
Usage
The Stock Predictor is run via a command-line interface. Follow these steps to make predictions:

Run the Main Script:
python main.py


Input a Stock Ticker:Enter a valid ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.).

Select a Model:Choose between LSTM (1) or Linear Regression (2).

View Results:The program outputs predicted prices and displays a plot of historical and forecasted prices.


Example Interaction:
$ python main.py
Enter stock ticker: AAPL
Select model (1: LSTM, 2: Linear Regression): 1
Fetching data for AAPL...
Training LSTM model...
Predicting...
Predicted prices for the next 5 days:
Day 1: $174.23
Day 2: $175.10
Day 3: $174.89
Day 4: $176.02
Day 5: $175.67
[Plot displayed: Historical vs. Predicted Prices]

Sample Visualization (Placeholder):Imagine a Matplotlib plot showing AAPLâ€™s closing prices for the past 60 days in blue, with predicted prices for the next 5 days in red. The x-axis represents dates, and the y-axis shows prices in USD. A legend distinguishes historical and predicted data.
Data Sources
The project fetches historical stock data from:

Yahoo Finance:

Accessed via the yfinance Python library.
Provides daily stock data (e.g., Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
Example usage in data_fetcher.py:import yfinance as yf
def fetch_stock_data(ticker, start_date, end_date):
    stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
    data = stock.history(start=start_date, end=end_date)
    return data['Close']




Extensibility:Modify data_fetcher.py to integrate other APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Quandl) or local datasets.


Model Details
The Stock Predictor implements two primary models, both trained on historical closing prices:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):

A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for time-series data.
Captures long-term dependencies in stock price movements.
Configurable parameters: look-back period (e.g., 60 days), number of epochs, LSTM units.
Example implementation (in models/lstm_model.py, inferred):from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
def build_lstm_model(input_shape):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(LSTM(50))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model




Linear Regression:

A traditional machine learning model for trend-based predictions.
Uses historical prices as features to predict future prices.
Simple and interpretable, suitable for linear trends.
Example implementation (in models/linear_model.py, inferred):from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
def build_linear_model():
    model = LinearRegression()
    return model




Customization:

Models are stored in the models/ directory.
Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., LSTM layers, training window) by editing model scripts.
